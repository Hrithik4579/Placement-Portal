# Placement-Portal

The Placement Portal is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the placement process for college and students. Built with the MERN stack, this portal bridges the gap between admin and students offering a seamless experience for managing job opportunities and applications and also allowing admins to control the permissions for students. I have developed this portal specifically for JIIT college making the TnP depatment as admin and students as users.

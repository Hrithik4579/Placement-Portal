# Placement-Portal

The Placement Portal is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the placement process for college and students. Built with the MERN stack, this portal bridges the gap between admin and students offering a seamless experience for managing job opportunities and applications and also allowing admins to control the permissions for students. I have developed this portal specifically for JIIT college making the TnP depatment as admin and students as users.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Styling: Bootstrap / custom
- Authentication and Authorization: JWT

## Key Features
### Admin Portal

### Students Portal

### RBAC Features
- User management which involves creating, modifying and deleting student profiles.
- No student can register themselves. Only the admin has the permission to add students and set their passwords to prevent outside college students from registering themselves.
- Admin has the permission to add and delete companies and roles as well as set the criteria such as cgpa and graduating year for applying. Students not meeting the criteria will not be permitted to apply for that particular job.
